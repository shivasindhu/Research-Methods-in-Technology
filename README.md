This research aims to explore how the time spent on Instagram affects the academic performance of Indian graduate students at Pittsburg State University. The study will focus on 218 Indian graduate students and analyze how their Instagram usage impacts their grades. The results of this study will be important for students, educational institutions, and policymakers who are interested in understanding how social media affects student performance. The main question of this research is: What effect does the time spent on Instagram have on the grades of Indian graduate students at Pittsburg State University? The study will use a descriptive research design to answer this question. Descriptive research helps provide a clear understanding of the relationship between two variablesâ€”in this case, Instagram usage and student grades. A quantitative research methodology will be used for this study, meaning the data will be collected and analyzed using numbers and statistics. An equal number of male and female students will participate, with 218 total students being surveyed. The survey will be conducted online, making it easier for students to participate. The data gathered from the students will be examined using quantitative analysis, which involves processing the numerical data to look for patterns and trends. Statistical methods will be used to ensure that the results are clear and meaningful. To ensure the accuracy of the findings, the research will use measures to check the reliability and validity of the data. Two methods, internal validation and internal consistency reliability, will be applied. These methods help make sure the results are trustworthy and consistent. Overall, this research will provide useful insights into how social media, specifically Instagram, affects student performance and offer guidance for students and educators on managing social media usage.
